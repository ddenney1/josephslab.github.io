## Maize TE Postdoc

A postdoctoral position is are available in the Josephs lab to work on an NSF funded project studying the evolutionary genetics of transposable elements (TEs) in maize. The position in the Josephs lab will focus on the phenotypic effects of TE polymorphisms using quantitative genetics approaches. Opportunities exist to collaborate on a number of ongoing projects in the labs, along with additional labs involved in the project (Nathan Springer’s lab and Candace Hirsch’s lab at the University of Minnesota, Shawn Kaeppler’s lab at the University of Wisconsin, and Jeff Ross-Ibarra's lab at the University of California, Davis). I believe in and value the power of diversity and applicants from historically underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply. 

Ideal candidates will have a background in transposable element biology, population genetics, and/or quantitative genetics. Experience with R, python, C++, or other programming languages is a plus. The position is for one year, with the potential for three more years of support conditional on performance. Start date is open-ended, with preference for an earlier date. 

I will begin reviewing applications on August 12. To apply, submit application materials [here](http://careers.msu.edu/cw/en-us/job/502026/research-associatefixed-term). Informal inquiries are welcome, please email me at josep993@msu.edu.

There is also a position available as part of the same project to work on the population genetics of TEs in maize and related species in [Jeff Ross-Ibarra's lab at UC Davis](http://www.rilab.org/te_pdoc.html). If you are interested in this position please send a cover letter and a CV with a list of references to rossibarra@ucdavis.edu. You are welcome to apply to both positions.
