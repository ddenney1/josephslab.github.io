# Opportunities in the Lab
The Josephs lab is looking for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs to join the lab.
Contact me at **josep113@msu.edu** if you want to talk about joining the lab!

**Graduate students** in my lab can apply through the [Plant Biology program](https://plantbiology.natsci.msu.edu/grad-program/how-to-apply/) and have an option to get involved in the [Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, & Behavior (EEBB)](https://eebb.natsci.msu.edu/) program.

## About the Lab
The Josephs Lab is based at Michigan State University in the [Department of Plant Biology](https://plantbiology.natsci.msu.edu/). 
MSU is a fun and vibrant place to be a scientist with lots of opportunities to collaborate locally (The lab shares a hallway with [The Weber Lab](http://www.theweberlab.com), [The Niederhuth Lab](http://niederhuth.github.io), and [The Lowry Lab](https://davidbryantlowry.wordpress.com)) and across the Plant Biology department and many other life sciences departments.
There are lots of great things about living in the East Lansing/Lansing area: 
affordability, all four seasons, microbreweries, minor-league baseball, and you can use your hand to explain to people where you live.
