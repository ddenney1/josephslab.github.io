## Opportunities in the Lab
The Josephs lab is looking for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs to join the lab.
Contact me at **josep993@msu.edu** if you want to talk about joining the lab!
**Graduate students** in my lab can apply through the [Plant Biology program](https://plantbiology.natsci.msu.edu/grad-program/how-to-apply/) and have an option to get involved in the [Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, & Behavior (EEBB)](https://eebb.natsci.msu.edu/) program.
I encourage potential **postdocs** to consider applying for independent funding and am happy to help develop project ideas for postdoc fellowships.
I am also hiring a postdoc for a funded project on transposable elements in maize.

### About the Lab

The Josephs Lab is based at Michigan State University in the [Department of Plant Biology](https://plantbiology.natsci.msu.edu/). 
MSU is a fun and vibrant place to be a scientist with lots of opportunities to collaborate locally (the lab shares a hallway with [the Weber Lab](http://www.theweberlab.com), [the Niederhuth Lab](http://niederhuth.github.io), and [the Lowry Lab](https://davidbryantlowry.wordpress.com)) as well as with other researchers in either the Plant Biology department or the many other life sciences departments.
There are lots of great things about living in the East Lansing/Lansing area: 
affordability, all four seasons, lakes (great and not-great), microbreweries, and minor-league baseball. 
You can also use your hand to explain to people where you live.
