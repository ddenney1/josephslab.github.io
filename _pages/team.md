### Maya Wilson Brown (Graduate Student)
Maya got her B.S. in Biology at Duke University studying hybrid seed incompatibility and speciation in monkey flowers (Mimulus) and morning glories (Ipomoea). She is interested in evolutionary biology, ecology, genetics, and loves strong espresso. Maya worked in the Josephs lab as a research technician for two years before starting as a PhD student.

### Adrian Platts (Bioinformatician)
Adrian started out in the Physical Sciences, gaining a BSc in Physics (specializing in Computational Physics) from the University of Birmingham followed by postgraduate work in novel magnetic materials. In 2004 he switched to a bioscience career initially working on human regulatory elements before moving on to plant genetics at McGill and then New York Universities.  He joined the Josephs lab and the [Edger Lab](https://www.polyploidy.msu.edu/patrick_edger/index.html) in 2020 and balances a home life based in A2 with a work life based around MSU.

### Miles Roberts (Graduate Student)
Miles is a graduate student in the Genetics and Genome Sciences program at MSU. He completed his B.S. at Washington State University where he majored in Biology and minored in Chemistry, Mathematics, and Quantitative Biology. His undergraduate research focused on the evolution of heavy-metal tolerance in bacteria, but his main interests now include plant genome and transcriptome evolution. In his free time, Miles is always looking to learn new programming languages, hike down interesting trails, and cook new recipes.

### Sophie Buysse (Graduate Student)
Sophie is a graduate student in the Plant Biology department and Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior dual degree program at MSU and she is cosupervised by Jeff Conner. She completed her B.A. in Biology at the College of St. Benedict and St. John’s University in Minnesota. Her research centers on the role of phenotypic plasticity in adaptation and evolution. Outside the lab, Sophie enjoys hiking, cross country skiing, gardening, and cooking.

### Asia Hightower (Graduate Student)
Asia is a graduate student in the Plant Biology program PhD program at MSU. She completed her B.A. and MS.c at Wayne State university where she majored in Biological sciences with a concentration evolutionary and developmental biology. Her master’s research focused on the developmental mechanism for floral meristem termination in dioecious *Spinacia oleracea*. Her main interests now include comparative leaf morphology and herbarium studies. In her free time, Asia is looking to improve her science communication skills and getting to know the East Lansing area.

### Nathan Catlin (Postdoc)
Nathan received his PhD from the University of Florida where he studied alternative splicing and gene duplication in rice and its wild relatives. Nathan is broadly interested in comparative genomics and population genomics, specifically how standing genetic variation in natural and breeding populations contribute to phenotypic diversity. Nathan is currently investigating TE insertions in maize and their contributions to trait variation.

### Mia Stevens (Research Technician)
Mia Stevens received her B.A. from The College of Wooster in Biology in 2020 studying pollination biology. She then spent two years as a lab manager with The Echinacea Project at the Chicago Botanic Garden studying habitat fragmentation. Broadly she is interested in how plants respond to their environment and is excited to learn new skills during her time with the Josephs lab. In her free time, she likes to explore the great outdoors, knit, and make yummy baked goods.
