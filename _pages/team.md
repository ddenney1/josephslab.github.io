She received a PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Toronto and was a postdoc at University of California, Davis in the Evolutionary Biology and Ecology department and the Center for Population Biology. Emily is generally excited by all things population and quantitative genetics, swimming, biking, and baking bread.
