### Adrian Platts (Bioinformatician)
Adrian started out in the Physical Sciences, gaining a BSc in Physics (specializing in Computational Physics) from the University of Birmingham followed by postgraduate work in novel magnetic materials. In 2004 he switched to a bioscience career initially working on human regulatory elements before moving on to plant genetics at McGill and then New York Universities.  He joined the Josephs lab and the [Edger Lab](https://www.polyploidy.msu.edu/patrick_edger/index.html) in 2020 and balances a home life based in A2 with a work life based around MSU.
