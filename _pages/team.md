### Emily Josephs (PI)

Emily is as an assistant professor in the Plant Biology department and AgBioResearch at Michigan State University. She received a PhD from the University of Toronto and was a postdoc at the University of California, Davis. Emily is generally excited about all things population and quantitative genetics, swimming, biking, and camping.

### Adrian Platts (Bioinformatician)
Adrian started out in the Physical Sciences, gaining a BSc in Physics (specializing in Computational Physics) from the University of Birmingham followed by postgraduate work in novel magnetic materials. In 2004 he switched to a bioscience career initially working on human regulatory elements before moving on to plant genetics at McGill and then New York Universities.  He joined the Josephs lab and the [Edger Lab](https://www.polyploidy.msu.edu/patrick_edger/index.html) in 2020 and balances a home life based in A2 with a work life based around MSU.

### Rebecca Panko (Postdoc)
Rebecca received her PhD from the Federated Department of Biological Sciences at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers University-Newark. A long-term resident of Brooklyn, New York, she has a strong interest in urban plant ecology and evolution. Her dissertation work examined how urbanization impacts shepherd’s purse (*Capsella bursa-pastoris*) populations in the New York Metropolitan Area. She is passionate about combating “plant blindness” and enjoys both teaching and community engagement to expose larger audiences to the importance of plants.

### Miles Roberts (Graduate Student)
Miles is a graduate student in the Genetics and Genome Sciences program at MSU. He completed his B.S. at Washington State University where he majored in Biology and minored in Chemistry, Mathematics, and Quantitative Biology. His undergraduate research focused on the evolution of heavy-metal tolerance in bacteria, but his main interests now include plant genome and transcriptome evolution. In his free time, Miles is always looking to learn new programming languages, hike down interesting trails, and cook new recipes.
