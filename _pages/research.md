# Research

- Why does genetic variation persist within populations? 
- What evolutionary forces shape genetic divergence between populations?
- How do plants adapt to their local environments (if they do)?

The lab is broadly interested in answering these questions using population genomic and quantitative genetic techniques with a focus on thinking about quantitative (complex) traits.


## Model systems

We are open to working in a number of crop or wild plant species. Some lab favorites are described below.

- Corn ('Maize', *Zea mays subsp. mays*) is not only delicious but a great genetic model for thinking about adaptation during domestication and breeding. Maize is currently grown at a staggering scale (over 96 million acres in the US alone!!) but is also grown world-wide in a range of habitats.

- *Capsella grandiflora* is a small weedy annual native to northern Greece and Albania. Itâ€™s an obligate outcrosser and a member of the Brassicaceae family. It often gets mistaken for Arabidopsis, but, unlike Arabidopsis, it has heart-shaped fruit and somewhat larger flowers. *C. grandiflora* has a few close relative species, *Capsella rubella*, *Capsella orientalis*, and *Capsella bursa-pastoris* that can be found across the globe.
