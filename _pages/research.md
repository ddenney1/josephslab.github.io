# Research

Why does genetic variation persist within populations? 
Why is there genetic divergence between populations? 
How do plants adapt to their local environments (if they do)?

The lab is broadly interested in answering these questions using population genomic and quantitative genetic techniques.

## Detecting local polygenic adaptation


## Maintenance of variation within populations


## Systems

#### Corn
Corn ('Maize', *Zea mays subsp. mays*) is not only delicious but a great genetic model for thinking about adaptation during domestication and breeding. Maize is currently grown at a staggering scale (over 96 million acres in the US alone!!) but is also grown world-wide in a range of habitats.

#### *Capsella grandiflora* and other Capsella species
