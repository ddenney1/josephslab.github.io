# Research

Why does genetic variation persist within populations? Why is there genetic divergence between populations? How do plants adapt to their local environments?

The lab is broadly interested in answering these questions using population genomic and quantitative genetic techniques.

## Detecting local polygenic adaptation


## Maintenance of variation within populations


## Systems

### Capsella grandiflora


### Corn
