## Diversity in Science
The lack of diversity in science is an important issue and it is our responsibility to educate ourselves about diversity issues in science, learn how to best combate discrimination, and work to promote equality within our scientific community. I am always happy to talk about these and related issues and will actively work to keep the Josephs lab a safe space.
