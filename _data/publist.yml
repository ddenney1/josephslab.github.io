- title: "Adaptive and maladaptive expression plasticity underlying herbicide resistance in an agricultural weed"
  image: morning_glory.jpg
  description: "In collaboration with Gina Baucom's lab at the University of Michigan, we investigated the potential for gene expression responses to herbicide to be adaptive. We used gene expression data from plants that had been grown with and without herbicide, along with expression data from artificial selection experiments for herbicide resistance to show that expression responses are often likely beneficial"

- title: "The evolutionary forces shaping cis- and trans-regulation of gene expression in a population of outcrossing plants"
  image: cistrans.png
  description: "We detected loci that affect the expression of nearby genes (cis-eQTLs) and of far away genes (trans-eQTLs) and compared their allele frequencies and other signatures of selection to show that negative selection acts more strongly on trans-eQTLs than cis-eQTLs. We also developed a method using coexpression networks to identify loci that affected the expression of large modules of genes with correlated expression"

- title: "Detecting adaptive differentiation in structured populations with genomic data and common gardens"
  image: genetics.png
  description: "We developed a method to detect local adaptation in diverse samples that have been genotyped and phenotyped in common garden. Specifically, we look for excess trait differentiation along the principal components of relatedness beyond an expectation based on neutral genetic drift. We then applied these methods to detect adaptation in domesticated maize."

- title: "The relationship between selection, network connectivity, and regulatory variation within a population of Capsella grandiflora"
  image: gbe.png
  description: "We used leaf expression data to construct coexpression networks that describe the correlation in expression between genes. Connectivity in these networks was associated with both the strength of negative selection on gene sequence and the presence of local regulatory variants ('eQTLs')"
